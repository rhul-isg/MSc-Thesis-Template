  title = {Generating {{Quantum States}} through {{Spin Chain Dynamics}}},
  abstract = {Spin chains can realise perfect quantum state transfer between the two ends via judicious choice of coupling strengths. In this paper, we study what other states can be created by engineering a spin chain. We conclude that, up to local phases, all single excitation quantum states with support on every site of the chain can be created. We pay particular attention to the generation of W-states that are superposed over every site of the chain.},
