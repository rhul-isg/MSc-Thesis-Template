This LaTeX template has been created by Alastair Kay for the use of MSc students at Royal Holloway University of London, Department of Mathematics. It's been modified by a student from the Information Security Group to be used within the department.

The file main.tex is the primary tex file in this template, and is the thing that you need to compile. However, it references many other files. The idea is that you store all your images in the images folder, and each chapter of text is a separate file in the chapters folder. titlepage.tex controls the format of the title page. references.bib is the bibtex database.

These files are provided with no support or warranty. You are free to modify them as you will.
