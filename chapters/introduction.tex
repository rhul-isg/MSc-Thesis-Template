Chapters are provided as different files. Have a poke around the file, and you'll see how it works. For some additional LaTeX support, have a look at \href{http://www.ma.rhul.ac.uk/akay/teaching/latex/}{Dr.\ Kay's LaTeX Training Webpage}.

Remember that when you compile a file, you should only compile the main tex file, not the sub-files, as these will just give lots of errors.
